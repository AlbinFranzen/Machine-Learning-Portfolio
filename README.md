# Albin Franzén - My journey in AI

### Personal Projects
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Implementations of Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch**<br />
I have created a [repository](https://github.com/AlbinFranzen/ML-Algorithms-From-Scratch) where I have implemented various machine learning algorithms from scratch using only python and numpy. The project demonstrates my theoretical knowledge in the subject and that I understand the underlying concepts and mathematics behind different algorithms in the field.



### Kaggle Competitions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Competition results**<br />
I enter kaggle competitions to practice my current skills and learn about new bleeding-edge models and preprocessing techniques. The downside with kaggle is that the data is most often presented in clean datasets which is unrealistic compared to real-world data gathering and preparation. Therefore I only use kaggle as a supplement to my personal projects and to improve my modelling techniques. Here you can see some of my kaggle results:

- Titanic
- MNIST

**Results from already closed competitions**<br />
I occasionally enter competitions which have already passed their deadlines to practice my ML workflow. Here are some results from what my submissions would have recieved had they been submitted in time:

- London
